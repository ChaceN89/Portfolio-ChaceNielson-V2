    <p>
      The <BoldSpan>Alberta Tomorrow Homepage</BoldSpan> is the central entry point for the Alberta Tomorrow platform, connecting students and educators to land-use education, environmental history, and sustainability tools across Alberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designed to support both classroom and independent learning, the homepage includes information about the <BoldSpan>organization</BoldSpan>, an <BoldSpan>Indigenous Voices module</BoldSpan>, access to <BoldSpan>lesson plans</BoldSpan>, <BoldSpan>educational videos</BoldSpan>, and acts as a hub to explore the <BoldSpan>land-use simulator</BoldSpan> and future tools like <BoldSpan>Energy Tomorrow</BoldSpan> and <BoldSpan>Wildlife Tomorrow</BoldSpan>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I designed and built the homepage as part of the broader Alberta Tomorrow platform team, where I also contribute to the development of the <BoldSpan>land-use simulator</BoldSpan> and related educational tools.
