    <p>
      <BoldSpan>Virtual Jenga</BoldSpan> is a haptics-driven game developed in <BoldSpan>Unity</BoldSpan> with <BoldSpan>C#</BoldSpan>, designed to replicate the traditional Jenga experience in a virtual environment. The game utilizes a tactile <BoldSpan>haptic stylus</BoldSpan> powered by the <BoldSpan>OpenHaptics toolkit</BoldSpan>, delivering a realistic sense of touch for block manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players can interact with the blocks using the haptic pen, experiencing tactile feedback that mimics the sensation of touching, pulling, and balancing blocks in real-time. This integration of haptic technology enhances the immersion, allowing users to feel the weight and texture of the virtual blocks as they play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting up the physics in Unity was a critical component of this project. Using <BoldSpan>Unity's Physics Engine</BoldSpan>, the blocks were carefully modeled to behave like their real-world counterparts, creating a simulation of weight, friction, and collisions. The physics system seamlessly interacts with the haptic feedback, ensuring that every touch and movement feels natural and responsive.
